# Beeline Toolkit — Copilot instructions

A **backend-free**, framework-free browser SPA (vanilla TypeScript + DOM) that drives the
**Beeline Velo 2** Android app over **WebUSB ADB** to batch-upload rides to **Strava**.
Everything runs in the browser: it reads the phone's screen (uiautomator XML), taps
buttons, and persists ride status in `LocalStorage`. There is no server and no API.

## Tech stack & commands

- **TypeScript 5.6** (strict), **Vite 6** (`base: "./"`, `target: "esnext"`), **Vitest 2** + **jsdom**, **leaflet** for maps.
- ADB transport: [`@yume-chan/adb`](https://github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb) (Tango) — Chromium-only, secure-context only.
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (boots in demo mode with sample rides).
- `npm run build` — `tsc --noEmit` type-check **then** `vite build`. Always type-check before considering a change done.
- `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` — Vitest.

## Changelog

Maintain [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) — an **internal** intent log (not public release notes).
Whenever you finish a logical change and its acceptance checks pass (`npm run build` + `npm test`
green), add an entry. This file is read by humans **and** the assistant as a compressed history of
decisions and values, so the "why" matters more than the "what".

- **One entry per logical change**, newest at the top. Squash `fixup!`-style follow-ups into the
  entry they belong to rather than adding a new one.
- **Reference the commit hash(es)** the change lands in (add the hash once committed; if you don't
  have it yet, leave a `TODO: hash` and fill it in after committing).
- **Capture intent**, not just the diff: the motivation, the decision, the trade-off — the context
  the terse commit message omits. Ground it in what the change actually did.
- **Format:**
  ```
  ## <short title>
  - **What:** one line — what changed.
  - **Why:** 1–2 lines — the motivation / decision / value behind it.
  - **Commits:** `hash`(, `hash` …)
  ```

## Conventions

- **Strict TS**: full null-safety, `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters` are on — no dead vars/params, no implicit `any`.
- **Naming**: `camelCase` functions (verb-prefixed: `parse…`, `upload…`), `PascalCase` classes/interfaces, `snake_case` string constants for storage keys.
- **Types**: `interface` for public contracts (`AdbDevice`, `RideRecord`); type aliases / discriminated unions for state (e.g. `TaskStatus = "queued" | "running" | …`).
- **Comments**: module-level docstrings explain purpose & design; `// -- section ----` headers group blocks; inline comments explain **why**, not what.
- **Async-first**: everything is `async/await` (WebUSB is async). Never block.
- **Subscriptions**: `onChange(fn)` returns an unsubscribe function — always store and call it on teardown.
- **Immutable-ish state**: mutate the `Store` only via `store.upsert(key, partial)`; let the Controller emit a change event to re-render.
- **No hardcoded screen coordinates**: derive every tap/swipe from `Geometry` (computed from `screenSize()`), so it works on any device resolution.
- **Transport abstraction**: code against the `AdbDevice` interface, never `WebUsbAdb`/`DemoAdb` directly — this is what keeps demo mode and tests working.
- **Minimal device round-trips**: every `uiDump`/tap/swipe is a real over-the-wire ADB call and the slowest thing we do (~10 s/ride already), so keep phone interaction quick — never add reads/gestures to the per-gesture happy path. Verify device state (foreground app via `currentFocus()`, current screen via `parseJourneysList`/`isRideDetail`) only at rare, high-stakes decision points — above all before marking a ride **deleted**, since one stray tap can drift us to another app/screen and an empty parse would otherwise look like "all rides gone". The guard `BeelineApp.onJourneysList()` is the canonical gate; `enumerateCatalog` returns a `complete` flag and `sweepTargets` pauses without deleting when that gate fails.
- **Unified map look & feel**: both Leaflet basemaps — the Explore per-ride mini-maps (`.rmap`) and the all-rides Map view (`#allRidesMap`) — share one dark, desaturated tile treatment (`.leaflet-tile-pane { filter: grayscale(85%) brightness(.6) contrast(1.1) }` over a `#05070a` container) so colored tracks pop consistently. Keep the two filter rules in sync; mini-maps draw a single ride with a white casing + solid orange line for legibility, while the Map view uses translucent overlapping lines as a heatmap.
- **Status/progress messages**: say exactly WHAT is happening and WHY, verbosely if needed — never vague counts. When acting on a specific ride, name it with the params we know (e.g. `rideShortLabel(key)` → "Jun 13 14:22"), not "1 ride". Prefer "scrolling down to find Jun 13 14:22…" over "scrolling down — looking for 1 ride…". When several rides are involved, name the first couple and append "(+N more)".
- **Error handling**: throw/catch `AdbError` for device issues; wrap `localStorage` access in `try/catch` (private mode can throw — non-fatal); surface failures to the user via `toast(message, isError)` and fall back to demo mode rather than crashing.

## Domain notes

- **Ride keys** are human dates like `"Sat Jun 13 2026 at 14:22"`; months are `"2026-06"` / `"June 2026"`.
- **Timing profiles** (`PROFILES`: `safe`/`normal`/`fast`/`turbo`) trade robustness for speed; `turbo` skips upload-verification reads (optimistic) and is reconciled by a later Check.
- **Job coalescing**: consecutive `upload`/`status`/`download-gpx` tasks merge into one sweep — preserve this when touching `JobQueue`.
- Only the **Strava** upload path is automated (komoot is detected but left alone).

## Testing

- Tests live in `tests/**/*.test.ts` (Vitest + jsdom).
- **Parser tests** run against real captured Beeline screens in [tests/fixtures/recon/](../tests/fixtures/recon/) — reuse these dumps rather than hand-writing XML.
- **Integration tests** drive a full `Controller` + `DemoAdb` (no phone). Wait for async work with `await vi.waitFor(() => expect(c.state().jobs.busy).toBe(false))`.
- Use the in-test `memStorage()` helper and a `makeController()` factory with an instant sleep — don't touch real `localStorage` or wall-clock delays in tests.
- **Demo GPX downloads never trigger a browser "Save As"**: `saveGpxFile()` in [src/main.ts](../src/main.ts) short-circuits when `isDemo` (demo bytes are synthetic; the route is still drawn on the map from the stored track). This keeps the browser-driven demo/test flow prompt-free — Chromium's "ask where to save each file" would otherwise pop a dialog per ride. Only real-device GPX is written to disk. Preserve this guard when touching the GPX save path.

## Gotchas

- UI automation is inherently brittle (~10 s/ride) and breaks if Beeline changes its layout — update coordinates/labels in [src/beeline.ts](../src/beeline.ts) and [src/parsing.ts](../src/parsing.ts) when that happens, and add a fresh fixture under `tests/fixtures/recon/`.
- WebUSB requires Chromium (Chrome/Edge) and a secure context (`localhost` or HTTPS); it is unavailable in Firefox/Safari.
- Keep new code dependency-light — this app intentionally has no backend and a tiny dependency set.
